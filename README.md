## Programming Tools
- IntelliJ IDEA - When it asks for administrator, say no, or use zip file
- Python - Turn off use admin. I recommend turning on adding python to path

- MinGW - Should just work if you use the MSYS2 version at least.
- QEMU - Just works.

## Other Tools/Apps
- Blender - Install from zip file

## Games
- Minecraft Vanilla - Install TL Legacy (because of DMCA use third party download source. Softonic should work.)
